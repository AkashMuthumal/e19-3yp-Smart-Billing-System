## Introduction

Welcome to the Smart Billing System project, where we're merging cutting-edge hardware and powerful software to streamline the billing process. Our platform combines a precision measuring device, barcode scanners, and a smart microcontroller to accurately identify items and calculate quantities. The software effortlessly computes the total bill and securely transmits this data to the cloud for further analysis. Users can easily create their bills using our system, revolutionizing traditional billing methods to provide a seamless, accurate, and user-friendly experience. Join us in simplifying the future of billing!
